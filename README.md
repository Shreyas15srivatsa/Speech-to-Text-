# Speech to Text App

## About
- This was a project I designed and developed along with 3 of my friends at the University of Toronto's MakeUofT 2019 
- Implemented an app that displays real-time public transport announcements onto passengers' phones
- Utilized Microsoft Azure's APIs to convert the speech to text. The converted text file is pushed to the Azure IoT Hub via the blob storage using a Raspberry Pi. 
- The app displays the content fetched from the SQL database via the Raspberry Pi.
